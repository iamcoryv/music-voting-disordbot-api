### Interactivity Component
In a version two it would be great to add more interactivity to the application. This could be accomplished through a chat feature where a user could interact with a bot to help guide their trip in the right direction, or to communicate directly with a seller.

### Expanded details
Additionally, it would be great to expand the product page to include more details on each item. Further, with an expanded set of products thereâ€™s great potential to track and add inventory to the page allowing new users to be both buyers and sellers.

### Search by category
We'd like to have implemented a search by category, where a user could select a category and only have products of that category appear as well.

## Document your planning, process and problem-solving strategy
After solidifying our idea for a project, our development team discussed our individual visions for the app and features that were important to include in an E-Commerce site. After setting up both repos, we began looking at user functionality for a new customer and setting up corresponding routes on our database. Our group's first notable issue emerged when dealing with nested routes, when defining the path from the shopping cart to checkout. This was a learning experience highlighting the complexities of nested routes. Another notably complex issue emerged when attempting to set up purchase history as an array, eventually though debugging we updated our code to include a .map method instead of a .forEach to correctly display the data. Generally our group worked together to develop and debug code, which proved to be an efficient workflow. As a group we communicated efficiently and periodically recalibrated our ways of attacking problems as our working relationship progressed. Collectively our group did well in defining our goals and adapting over the course of the project to ensure that we put forward our best effort.
